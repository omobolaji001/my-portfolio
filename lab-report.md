### How does Git help in DevOps team?
Git helps in DevOps team by promoting automation, collaboration, and faster release cycle amongst other features.

### Challenges
While creating the 'my-portfolio' repository on github, I included a LICENCE which results to conflict while trying to push my local main branch to the repository.

### Solution
I was able to resolve the challenge by simply following the Git error messages, I could not merge the branches but I was able to resolve the conflict and rebase before pushing to the remote branch.
